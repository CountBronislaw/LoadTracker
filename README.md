# LoadTracker
LoadTracker is an application I created to help me log my reloading sessions to gain potentially useful metrics and as a method of learning Ruby/Ruby on Rails. It is still very much a work in progress.

## Features
Here are some of the planned features:
* Session logging. Logging reloading sessions is a core feature of LoadTracker.
* Tool-wear tracking. See how many rounds have been processed on dies, presses, etc.
* Track statistics on different loads.
